        <h2>Project Details</h2>
        <p>The EcoFuelizer is designed to help reduce plastic waste while generating fuel. Below are the details of the project:</p>
        
        <h3>Process Overview</h3>
        <p>EcoFuelizer uses pyrolysis to heat plastic to high temperatures (400-500°C) in the absence of oxygen, turning plastic into fuel vapors. These vapors are then condensed into liquid fuels like gasoline and diesel.</p>
        
        <h3>What is Pyrolysis?</h3>
        <p>Pyrolysis is a thermochemical process that decomposes organic materials at elevated temperatures in the absence of oxygen. During pyrolysis, long-chain polymers in plastics break down into smaller hydrocarbons, which are vaporized and then condensed into liquid fuels.</p>

        <h3>Pyrolysis Stages</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Heating the Plastic:</strong> The plastic waste is heated in a chamber with no oxygen, reaching temperatures of up to 500°C.</li>
            <li><strong>Decomposition:</strong> The high heat causes the plastic to decompose into gases, including methane, propane, and butane, as well as longer-chain hydrocarbons.</li>
            <li><strong>Condensation:</strong> These gases are cooled down, condensing into liquid forms like gasoline and diesel.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Estimated Output</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>For every 5 kg of plastic waste, the EcoFuelizer produces:</li>
            <li>2.5 liters of gasoline</li>
            <li>0.5 liters of diesel</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Energy Consumption</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Heating Element Power: 1.5 kW</li>
            <li>Total Energy Consumption per Batch: 7.5 kWh</li>
            <li>Cost of Electricity: $0.12/kWh</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Earnings Calculation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Electricity Cost per Batch: $0.90</li>
            <li>Fuel Value from 5 kg of Plastic:</li>
            <li>2.5 liters of gasoline at $0.925/liter = $2.31</li>
            <li>0.5 liters of diesel at $1.057/liter = $0.53</li>
            <li>Total Fuel Value per Batch: $2.84</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Net Profit Calculation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Net Profit per Batch: $2.84 - $0.95 = $1.89</li>
            <li>Time to Earn Back Initial Investment ($1,000): 530 batches (~1.45 years)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Environmental Impact</h3>
        <p>Using the EcoFuelizer, a typical family can convert their plastic waste into fuel every 3-4 days, drastically reducing their contribution to plastic pollution. The EcoFuelizer also lowers the need for conventional fuels, reducing overall carbon footprints.</p>
